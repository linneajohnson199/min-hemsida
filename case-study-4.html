        <p id="describe">​Revolutionizing their online presence, the Equestrian Club embarked on a mission to elevate its existing website to modern heights. This transformation unfolded as a quest for contemporary design and enhanced functionality. <strong>Ready to saddle up?</strong></p>
        <h2>About the client</h2>
        <p>As a member of Hylte Equestrian Club, you will have access to riding lessons, private stables for rental, and a competitive program catering to riders of all levels. The club strives to create a welcoming and inclusive community for riders of all abilities and interests, whether you're looking to compete or simply enjoy the companionship of horses. Located in Rydöbruk, between Hylte and Halmstad, the club offers a variety of activities based on the dedication of the volunteers and a strong sense of community. The goal is to offer meaningful activities with horses for individuals of all levels, community and joy form the foundation of the club.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Hylte ryttarförening website is currently facing issues such as being outdated, difficult to navigate, unprofessional and unattractive. These issues make it challenging for users to find the information they need. By updating the website's design, structure and navigation, we can provide users with a visually attractive, easy to navigate, informative and professional website. This will enable them to access important information with ease, making it a more pleasant and successful experience for the users.</p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>​The team conducted research on other similar websites, analyzing their navigation structures. Additionally, I delved into an examination of the client's company to gain a comprehensive understanding of all areas. Various methods, including user testing, were employed to gain insights into the opinions of current website users regarding the navigation structure and information flow. This was done to cater to their needs. Our primary focus was on creating a functional structure that was logical in relation to the information that needed to be visualized. </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The solution led to an enhanced and redesigned website, emphasizing navigation structure, information flow, and a visually appealing concept. The client chose to implement this solution and currently utilizes the upgraded website. The solution is primarily aimed at riding students, guardians of students, and other stakeholders within the association who require information.</p>

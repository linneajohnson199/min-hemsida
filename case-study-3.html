        <p id="describe">Navigating the dentist can be a source of anxiety for many children, each with unique needs. It's crucial to discover approaches that not only ensure every child feels safe but also transform the experience into something enjoyable. <strong>Let´s see if we can create a playful experience.</strong> </p>
        <h2>About the client</h2>
        <p>Specialist dental care is dedicated to providing top-notch dental services to children and adults who have special needs, illnesses, disabilities, or fear of dentistry. They understand that every individual is unique and strive to accommodate all patients during their visits to the dentist. They collaborate with health and medical services, as well as other dental clinics, to ensure that all customers feel safe and receive specialized care. In addition to providing dental care, they also prioritize research, education, and quality monitoring to constantly improve their services. With the help of their dedicated team, they are committed to making sure that every patient has a positive experience at the dentist.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The project at hand aims to address a major problem faced by Specialisttandvården in effectively communicating information about dental care to children and individuals with disabilities. The current methods used, such as flip charts, stuffed animals with teeth, and PowerPoint, were found to be outdated and ineffective in engaging the target audience. To address this, the solution proposed is an iPad-adapted application with four interactive functions that demonstrate good oral hygiene, including visualizing the effects of poor hygiene and the benefits of proper brushing. This will help to overcome the problem of not effectively communicating information about oral health and keep children engaged.</p>
<h4>How can we make learning about dental health fun and engaging for children?</h4>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>The team conducted research on pediatric dental care, focusing on the specific aspects the client aimed to visualize within the intended application. Additionally, we delved into how children learn best, gathering valuable insights that informed our design decisions. With the client having a general idea of the desired application, we collaborated with them to design the expected features. Throughout this process, continuous insights were gained, contributing to the refinement of the final prototype.</p>
<h4>Findning: Children learn best through physical and visual stimulation, which involves engaging their senses and motor skills. </h4>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The solution resulted in a playful application intended to serve as a tool for dentists to educate children about oral health. The outcome of this project is a design solution primarily aimed at capturing the engagement of children aged 5-12 years. Based on the client's preferences, four features were implemented, covering aspects such as cavities, gum inflammation, self-care, and a sugar clock.</p>
    
        <h2>Designprocess</h2>
        <p>​Below is a bullet-point list of challenges, insights, and methods used in the project. </p>

                    <h3>Challenges and insights:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The main learning from this phase was that there are two main dental problems when it comes to children (caries and gum inflammation), which follow a chronological order.</li>
                        <li>There was a challenge to understand the connection between the different diseaseprocesses</li>
                        <li>This realization allowed the most important disease processes to be "baked into" two main flows, (caries and gum inflammation).</li>
                        <li>In addition, a concrete model was built of exactly how many steps each flow would contain and what each step would look like.</li>
                    </ul>

        <p id="describe"><strong>​Ever felt excluded from digital spaces?</strong> For the colorblind, this can be a daily reality. Many websites still overlook accessibility guidelines, making it challenging for them to fully participate. Let's prioritize inclusive design to ensure a digital world where everyone feels welcome. Maybe this is the way to make people understand?</p>
        <h2>Colorblindness and Sustainability</h2>
        <p>Colorblindness affects around 8% of men and 0.5% of women globally, influencing how individuals perceive colors. In the realm of sustainability and digital design, acknowledging colorblindness is vital for inclusivity. Failing to consider this can hinder the user experience for a significant portion of the audience. Sustainable design means creating visually accessible content for everyone, ensuring a positive impact on a diverse audience.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>In many digital environments, accessibility is often overlooked. A deficiency exists within digital collaboration spaces, where minimal attention is given to accessibility. This project specifically targets the perception and experiences of colorblind individuals within digital collaborative environments. The team opted to approach this issue with a focus on promoting social sustainability for the colorblind community. The driving knowledge question for this project is: How can norm-critical design be employed to address the exclusion of colorblind individuals in digital collaborative environments?</p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>To address this issue, research on colorblindness was conducted, utilizing surveys to gather data from individuals with various forms of color vision deficiency. Additionally, exploration extended to digital collaborative environments, exclusion, digital accessibility, and norm-critical perspectives. After gaining insights and generating ideas for different approaches, a workshop emerged as a suitable method. During the workshop, we incorporated a computer plugin that simulates approximately how a person with color blindness perceives colors. This allowed participants (non-colorblind individuals) to experience an approximation of what it is like to be colorblind, enhancing their understanding of the challenges faced by individuals with color vision deficiencies. Through this immersive experience, we not only highlighted the issue of exclusion but also provided participants with a platform to share their opinions and experiences.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The outcome for this project took the form of a workshop, functioning as our artifact. Its purpose was to evoke responses from participants without color blindness, thereby emphasizing the issue of exclusion.The purpose of the workshop was to stimulate discussion around the problem and identify necessary measures to address the issue. Our hope is that businesses, organizations, and individuals can utilize this workshop to promote awareness about the exclusion of colorblind individuals in digital collaborative environments. To comprehend and address an issue, there needs to be an awareness created for people to take initiative. This is why we chose to establish a workshop, as we believe that enlightenment can foster societal commitments. The workshop incorporates segments with individual queries and discussion prompts to foster engagement and exploration.</p>

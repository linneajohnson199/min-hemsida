        <p id="describe">Annually, Tylösand in Halmstad hosts a major golf tournament, drawing crowds. To tackle limited parking, our project aimed to reduce cars and promote eco-friendly transport like public transit. <strong>Picture a sunny day at the beach, but no parking and packed buses, how frustrating is that? </strong> Our goal was to alleviate this and encourage a more convenient and sustainable travel experience.</p>
        <h2>About the client</h2>
        <p>Destination Halmstad is a company that promotes Halmstad as a tourist destination by providing information and recommendations for local events, attractions, dining, and lodging options. Their goal is to support the development of Halmstad as a visitor destination, targeting tourists unfamiliar with the city and working towards making it a sustainable and marketable destination for visitors, meetings, and events.</p>

        <h5>We visited Tylösand and the golf area, and the team used different transports to understand the experience of every approaches.</h5>
    

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Volvo Cars Scandinavian Mixed is an annual event held at Tylösand's golf club in early June, which have faced difficulties in getting to the event from Halmstad center such as traffic and parking. Destination Halmstad aims to improve this experience by promoting sustainable transportation options to change established behavior patterns and encourage more environmentally friendly means of transport to be used. The goal of this project was to create a positive overall experience for visitors by promoting sustainable means of transport.</p>
        <h4>How can we improve the visitor experience while promoting sustainable transportation?</h4>
        
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>The team conducted extensive research on Destination Halmstad and all stakeholders affected by this solution. To address the issues of congestion and challenges with parking spaces and public transportation, we opted for methods to collect data that would guide our next steps. We generated insights into potential frustrations that could arise, aiming to reduce them. Once identified, we focused on preventive measures or strategies to alleviate these frustrations. This approach led to the development of a feature displaying all relevant information for traveling to Tylösand, regardless of the chosen mode of transportation.</p>

        <h5>Here is a sketch of the concept.</h5>
    

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The goal of the project was to develop a design solution that helps to change established behavioral patterns related to car usage and makes it easier to choose environmentally friendly and sustainable transportation options. The solution resulted in an enhancement of the existing application "A Day in Halland". The upgrade included an addition promoting sustainability, allowing users to choose eco-friendly modes of transportation and displaying their availability. The add-on features all transportation modes (biking, scooters, walking, car, and public transport) presenting information on which is the fastest, most environmentally friendly, and cost-effective.</p>
